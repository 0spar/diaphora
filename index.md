### Welcome!

Diaphora (διαφορά, Greek for 'difference') is a program diffing plugin for IDA Pro and Radare2, similar to Zynamics Bindiff or the FOSS counterparts DarunGrim, TurboDiff, etc... It was released during SyScan 2015.

It works with IDA Pro 6.9, 6.95 and 7.0. In batch mode, it supports Radare2 too ([check this fork](https://github.com/radare/diaphora)). In the future, adding support for Binary Ninja is also planned.

For more details, please check the tutorial in the "doc" directory.

As with any open source project, any form of help for this project is highly appreciated. You can submit your own patches, make feature requests, report bugs or <a href="#donate">donate</a> to support the development of Diaphora.

## Getting help and asking for features

You can join the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=es#!forum/diaphora) to ask for help, new features, report issues, etc... For reporting bugs, however, I recommend using the [issues tracker](https://github.com/joxeankoret/diaphora/issues). You can also check the (Wiki)[https://github.com/joxeankoret/diaphora/wiki] that answers some of the most common questions.

Please note that, officially, only the last 2 versions of IDA will be supported. As of today, however, 6.9, 6.95 and 7.0 are supported. Version 6.8 isn't supported any more but is known to work.
